CAR ==> the first element of its list parameter
   (CAR ′(A B C)) ==> A

CDR ==> the remainder of its list parameter after the first element has been removed
   (CDR ′(A B C)) ==> (B C)

CONS puts its first parameter into its second parameter, a list, to make a new list
 (CONS ′A ′(B C)) ==> (A B C)

LIST ==> a new list of its parameters
 (LIST ′A ′B ′(C D)) ==> (A B (C D))

(EQV? 6 6) ==> #T

(EQV? 3 4) ==> #F
